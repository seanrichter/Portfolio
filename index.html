            <img src="assets\images\capture1.PNG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

            <p>Hello, my name is Sean! I enjoy moonlight strolls on the beach, red roses by the armful, and
                tap-dancing the night away.</p>

            <p>Just kidding! Im not a fan of any of those things except the occasional night of dancing under the right
                circumstances. More seriously, my friends would describe me as easy going, a good listener, wordsmith at
                scrabble, and someone who can whip up a delicious breakfast.</p>

            <p>I have many hobbies that include music, golfing, and fishing.
                My most recent hobby has become web development. I had a friend do a similar
                bootcamp a few years ago.
                Before my friend did this, i actually had never heard of coding/web development!! i knew somebody out
                there was magically creating web content but no idea how they were doing it. So here i am today
                presenting to you some of my finished and unfinished work.
                I am nowhere near where i would like to be when it comes to fullstack development.
                However, i am a dedicated individual that has the initiative and passion to learn something new!
            </p>

            <p>Please feel free to take a look at my Portfolio and Skills. Also, drop me a message in the Contacts Page
                if you want to critique.
                Thank you for visiting!!
            </p>
